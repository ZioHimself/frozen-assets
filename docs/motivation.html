                    served as a real stress test for Belgium's security architecture, exposing its insufficient
                    readiness to respond and prompting defence assistance from neighboring European countries. Belgium's
                    experience is part of a broader pattern across Europe. Russia has violated the airspace of at least
                    14 EU member states, with hundreds of drones and three fighter jets entering the EU airspace and a
                    plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen <a

                    case occurred in Poland, when in early September the country was attacked with 21 drones, resulting
                    in an <a

                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Article 4 consultation within NATO</a>.
                </p>

                <p>As Russian drones get increasingly bold flying around the airspace of Belgium and the rest of the EU,
                    collecting information about the state of military sites and critical infrastructure, the European
                    Union struggles to find means to fund its security and provide military support to Ukraine, a
                    country that is holding back the Russian attempt at a greater assault on the EU as the Russian
                    threat becomes increasingly tangible.</p>

                <p>Providing direct military support to Ukraine through grants and debt becomes increasingly difficult
                    as major EU Member States, like Germany, France and Poland, are facing budgetary constraints due to
                    increased governmental debt.</p>

                <p>Against this background, the European Commission has tabled an innovative proposal to use Russian
                    frozen assets to mobilise €140bn, which can fund Ukraine for several years, at least until 2027.
                    Several options are still on the table, with high-level political talks accelerating in the past few
                    days. A major blow could be dealt to Russia's flailing economy by funding Ukraine through these
                    funds.</p>

                <p>However, at the last European Council, EU leaders could not reach an agreement to support the
                    initiative primarily due to the Belgian position, with Prime Minister Bart De Wever voicing concerns
                    over the legality and financial risks of such an initiative.</p>

                <h2>Legal concerns</h2>

                <p>Under the Commission's plan, €140 billion of Russia's Central Bank frozen reserves would be used as
                    collateral to issue an interest-free reparations loan for Ukraine, which it would only repay upon
                    receiving war reparations from Russia. In this way, the funds would not be seized, and the EU would
                    replace the Russian cash on Euroclear accounts with bonds issued by the European Commission. While
                    state-owned property is generally protected from seizure or expropriation, <a
                        href="https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/9_6_2001.pdf"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">international law provides an exception</a> when a
                    state commits serious wrongdoing. In such situations, other countries may temporarily suspend
                    certain obligations toward the responsible state in order to force it to comply with international
                    law. Accordingly, the expropriation of Russian frozen assets could be lawfully undertaken until
                    Russia ends its aggression and pays reparations for the damages caused.</p>

                <p>Bart De Wever stated that sovereign assets have never been seized before. However, they were used in
                    similar levies, such as USD 50bn <a
                        href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2446a0d-de0a-4cc0-a600-87dc1643f844" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">from Iraq to Kuwait</a>, as well as other seizures from <a

                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Iraq</a>, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Libya and <a

                <h2>Risk of retaliation</h2>

                <p>Belgium has expressed fears of potential legal claims or arbitration from Russia if the frozen assets
                    are used in this manner. Prime Minister De Wever has emphasised (rightfully so) the <a
                        href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/belgium-says-eu-leaders-must-share-risk-use-frozen-russian-assets-ukraine-2025-10-02/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">need for shared risk</a> among EU member states,
                    stating, "Taking Putin's money and leaving the risks with us. That's not going to happen… let me be
                    very clear about that."</p>

                <p>Mr De Wever particularly referred to the possibility of Russia filing a claim before an investment
                    tribunal under the 1989 Belgium-Luxembourg-Soviet Union investment treaty. While the treaty might
                    allow the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) to initiate a dispute, its chances of winning are extremely
                    low, and any proceedings might take decades.</p>

                <p>Investment tribunals interpret treaties in line with higher principles of international law. Russia's
                    violation of peremptory norms and the CBR's role in the aggression, especially given Russia's own <a
                        href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-seize-european-energy-assets-omv-wintershall/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seizure of European assets</a> like those of Total,
                    Danone, and Carlsberg, would weigh heavily against it. Investment tribunals also recognise lawful
                    countermeasures in response to another State's wrongful acts. Case law further distinguishes between
                    compensable and non-compensable expropriation, meaning no compensation is required when a measure
                    serves a legitimate public purpose, is non-discriminatory, proportionate, and taken in good faith.
                    Thus, no compensation is required. <em>Ex iniuria ius non oritur</em>—law does not arise from
                    wrongdoing, so Russia has no quick and direct claim. Additionally, all of the above would only apply
                    in the case of actual asset seizure and not in the scenario in which Russian assets are used as
                    collateral for a loan.</p>

                <h2>The cost of inaction</h2>

                <p>While the Belgian government fears the price it might pay if the Russian threats to take revenge for
                    the asset expropriation materialise, what cost would we pay if we don't do it?</p>

                <p>In the past few months, Russia has already shown how it can effectively disrupt the Belgian economy
                    with drone interference. According to estimates, the cost of one airport disruption incident could
                    easily <a
                        href="https://www.aviation24.be/miscellaneous/drones/incident-above-belgium-economic-damage-likely-runs-into-millions/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exceed €2 million</a>, with possibly much higher
                    losses once indirect costs are calculated. Russian sabotage operations against Europe already <a
                        href="https://www.iiss.org/globalassets/media-library---content--migration/files/research-papers/2025/08/pub25-095-the-scale-of-russian-sabotage-operations.pdf"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include all types of critical infrastructure</a>:
                    energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructure, health, water, digital infrastructure,
                    and government facilities (including military installations). While difficult to estimate, Europe
                    has already lost several billion euros due to these hybrid acts of aggression.</p>

                <p>A clear political choice lies ahead for Belgium in December. Do we want to return money to an
                    aggressor that already undermines our national security and would likely use those funds to
                    intensify its attacks? Or do we choose to help preserve Ukraine's sovereignty while strengthening
                    Europe's deterrence and capacity for self-defence?</p>

                <p>In 1990, 2008 and 2014, Europe hesitated. Each time, war broke out, and the cost grew. Today, Belgium
                    holds Europe's key financial leverage over the Kremlin. Hesitation now will cost Belgium and Europe
                    much more later.</p>

                <h2>A chance to lead</h2>

                <p>We thus have a chance to be the driver of strengthening the European defence, security, and global
                    influence, while reinforcing the international rule of law. Moreover, by taking a leadership role in
                    the process, it can determine how exactly the reparation loan mechanism would work. Many times in
                    history, Belgium was at the forefront of ambitious diplomatic progress. Belgium led Europe in
                    building institutions capable of preventing war, and now is a chance to do it again.</p>

                <p>Appeasing Russia or bending to its threats will not ensure the EU's long-term peace and security.
                    Moscow's pressure is a sign that it fears EU unity regarding the confiscation of frozen assets.
                    Burden-sharing is legitimate, and practical solutions do exist, as Norway recently showed
                    willingness to explore creative ideas with EU Member States. Belgium's national interests do not
                    have to coincide with Euroclear's short-termist and numbers-driven approach. By promoting robust
                    collective EU action at the European Council meeting in December, Prime Minister Bart De Wever can
                    play a decisive leadership role in helping to end Russia's war against Ukraine and restore peace and
                    justice in Europe. The time to act is now.</p>
