**Dear Prime Minister Bart De Wever,**  
**Dear Members of the Federal Parliament,**

We, the undersigned Belgian citizens and residents, academics, lawyers, economists, former diplomats, and representatives of civil society, are writing to urge decisive leadership on the use of immobilised Russian state assets to support Ukraine and reinforce Europe’s security.

As Belgium holds approximately €175 billion in cash (matured from bond holdings) of immobilised Russian Central Bank assets, accounting for almost two-thirds of all Russian assets immobilised worldwide, our country is in a uniquely influential position at a moment when Russia’s war against Ukraine has direct implications for European stability and for Belgium’s own security.

### **1\. Belgium is increasingly targeted by hybrid threats**

The recent disruptions at Belgian airports caused by drones, together with repeated detections near military installations, port areas, and critical infrastructure, signal a clear intensification of Russian hybrid operations in Western Europe.

These incidents are not isolated; they are part of a deliberate pattern of hybrid warfare aimed at creating economic damage, endangering citizens, and exerting pressure on our national security services.

In this context, it is essential that Europe strengthens its deterrence. Supporting Ukraine, currently containing Russia’s military aggression, is both an act of solidarity and a measure of self-protection for EU member states, including Belgium. Putin has made clear he has no intention of pursuing genuine peace negotiations while Russia’s war machine operates at full capacity and while he believes he can simply outlast Western support and drive us slowly apart. A multi-year financing package backed by frozen Russian assets eliminates this expectation, making the war more costly for the Kremlin and forcing it finally to take real negotiations seriously. 

The proposed loan structure would provide multi-year predictable support without requiring annual budget negotiations, reducing political uncertainty and enabling more effective long-term defense planning. The mechanism for using frozen Russian assets isn’t an escalation, it actually makes the war more costly for Russia and accelerates the incentive to pursue peace.

### **2\. The European proposal is responsible, legally grounded, and urgently needed**

The European Commission has proposed a mechanism, the 'reparations loan', that does not involve the seizure of Russian state assets, but allows their temporary substitution: the cash held by Euroclear would be transferred to the Commission, which would then issue an interest-free reparations loan to Ukraine (with financing costs effectively borne by Russia through the asset substitution mechanism). The original Russian assets would be repaid only after Russia ends its aggression and provides compensation for war damages.

International law provides a basis for such measures through the doctrine of countermeasures against states committing internationally wrongful acts, including grave breaches of obligations under the UN Charter (UN International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 22, 49-54). Historical practice demonstrates various approaches to frozen sovereign assets in contexts of aggression or serious international violations, including assets held following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait (under UNSC authorization), German and Japanese assets after World War II (under post-conflict settlements), and Iranian and Libyan assets frozen following determinations of state responsibility for terrorism.

Moreover, Belgian and European assets belonging to private companies were recently nationalized by Russia itself, which underlines the principle of ex iniuria ius non oritur: no right can be derived from an unlawful act. Belgium therefore has many counterarguments based on the highest international regulations in the event of arbitration.

With a sound legal foundation established, the central question becomes one of strategic judgment:  which risk is greater, acting or failing to act?

### **3\. The cost of inaction is already visible**

Russian sabotage and cyber operations are already exacting a financial and security toll on Europe. The disruptions at Brussels and Liège airports alone caused between €1.5 and €3 million in direct losses only[^1].

Drones targeting transport hubs, energy facilities and military installations represent a growing threat. These incidents raise the question of how long Belgium can remain vulnerable without taking stronger measures.

Belgium now faces a clear choice. Will we return billions to a state actively undermining our national security, resources that may be used to intensify these attacks, or will we help Ukraine defend itself while strengthening Europe’s deterrence and capacity for self-defence?

### **4\. Belgium is not alone, solutions exist, and partners are ready**

The Prime Minister’s call for risk sharing is justified. Several EU member states, such as Germany, Finland, Sweden and the Baltic countries, have already expressed support for a joint guarantee framework. The United Kingdom, Canada and Japan are also exploring similar arrangements. A coordinated European guarantee framework would distribute any potential arbitration or enforcement costs across participating states, significantly reducing individual exposure while maximizing collective deterrence.

Belgium is not isolated. By taking a leadership role, our country can help shape a fair and robust reparation loan mechanism. Belgium has a long tradition of leading diplomatic progress within Europe and now has the opportunity to do so again.

We can drive efforts that strengthen Europe’s defence, security and global influence while upholding international law and European values. The time to act is now.

**We thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.**  
**We sincerely hope that Belgium will rise to meet this moment, honouring its history and assuming the responsibility that its unique position confers.**
