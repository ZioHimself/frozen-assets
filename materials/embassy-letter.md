**Your Excellency,**

We, the undersigned citizens and residents, academics, lawyers, economists, former diplomats, and representatives of civil society living in <country>, are writing to urge the Government of Belgium to demonstrate decisive leadership on the use of immobilised Russian state assets to support Ukraine and reinforce Europe’s security.

Belgium currently holds approximately €175 billion in cash (matured from bond holdings) of immobilised Russian Central Bank assets — nearly two-thirds of all such assets frozen worldwide. This places Belgium in a uniquely influential position at a moment when Russia’s war against Ukraine has direct implications for European stability and for Belgium’s own national security.

**1\. Belgium is increasingly targeted by hybrid threats <If you have numbers on your country it is worth to add>**  
Recent drone-related disruptions at Belgian airports, alongside repeated detections near port areas, military installations, and critical infrastructure, point to a clear intensification of Russian hybrid operations in Western Europe. These incidents are part of a deliberate strategy intended to cause economic damage, endanger citizens, and undermine national security.  
Strengthening Europe’s deterrence is essential. Supporting Ukraine — the country currently containing Russia’s military aggression — is both an act of solidarity and a measure of self-protection for all EU member states, including Belgium.  
A multi-year financing package backed by frozen Russian assets would eliminate Russia’s expectation that it can simply “wait out” Western support. This approach raises the cost of aggression for the Kremlin and increases the likelihood of genuine negotiations. Importantly, this mechanism reduces political uncertainty by providing predictable long-term support without requiring annual EU budget negotiations.

**2\. The European proposal is responsible, legally grounded, and urgently needed**  
The European Commission’s proposed “reparation loan” does not seize Russian state assets. Instead, it allows their temporary substitution: Euroclear would transfer the cash to the Commission, which would then issue an interest-free loan to Ukraine. The original Russian assets would be repaid only once Russia ends its aggression and provides compensation for war damages.  
International law provides a robust basis for such action through the doctrine of countermeasures against states committing internationally wrongful acts (UN ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 22, 49–54).  
Historical precedents exist — including Iraqi, German, Japanese, Iranian, and Libyan sovereign assets — demonstrating that the international community has long applied various mechanisms for handling frozen assets linked to aggression or serious violations.  
Furthermore, Russia itself has nationalised Belgian and European private assets, reinforcing the principle *ex iniuria ius non oritur*: no state may derive rights from its own unlawful actions.

**3\. The cost of inaction is already visible**  
Russian sabotage and cyber operations are imposing real financial and security costs on Europe. Drone disruptions at Brussels and Liège airports alone resulted in €1.5–3 million in direct losses.  
The question now is how long Belgium can remain vulnerable without strengthening deterrence — and whether returning billions to a state conducting hostile operations in Europe would further endanger Belgian and EU security.

**4\. Belgium is not alone: partners stand ready, and solutions exist**  
Prime Minister De Wever’s call for risk sharing is valid. Several EU states — including Germany, Finland, Sweden, and the Baltic countries — support establishing a joint guarantee framework. The UK, Canada, and Japan are exploring similar solutions.  
A coordinated guarantee mechanism would spread potential legal or arbitration risks, reducing the burden on any one state while maximising collective deterrence.  
Belgium is not isolated. On the contrary, Belgium can help shape a fair, balanced, and effective reparation loan structure. Belgium has a strong diplomatic tradition and now has an opportunity to lead once more — strengthening European defence, security, and global leverage while upholding international law.

We thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.  
We sincerely hope Belgium will rise to meet this moment, honouring its history and fulfilling the responsibility that its unique position confers.
