# Presentation Outline: Responding to Bart De Wever's Arguments on Russian Frozen Assets

## Strategic Approach

This presentation responds to Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever's concerns about using frozen Russian assets for Ukraine. It is designed for a general audience (journalists, policymakers, civil society) and structured to work alongside your document database at frozen-assets.eu.

**Core Strategy**: **Front-load the knockout arguments.** Since most web visitors will only read the first 5 slides, these deliver the most compelling counter-arguments with maximum informational density. Later slides provide technical depth for those who want complete documentation.

**Structure**:
- **Slides 1-5**: The Core Case (highest impact, designed for maximum readership)
  - Establishes Belgium is already paying concrete costs NOW
  - Exposes the logical contradiction in De Wever's position
  - Systematically answers all three core objections
  - Proves EU already took greater risks for lesser objectives
  
- **Slides 6-21**: Technical Support & Additional Arguments (for detailed analysis)
  
- **Slides 22-24**: Call to Action (for those ready to act)

## SLIDE 1: Title Slide - The Choice Belgium Faces
**Title**: "Belgium's Choice: Lead Europe or Return Money to Its Aggressor?"
**Subtitle**: Why Prime Minister De Wever's Concerns Don't Hold Up

**Visual**: Powerful split image
- Left: Russian drones over Doel nuclear plant / Belgian airports
- Right: €140 billion that could fund Ukraine's defense

**Opening Text**: 
"Prime Minister De Wever says using frozen Russian assets is 'too risky.' But Belgium is already paying the price of inaction. Every day of delay costs more."

**Note**: Immediately frames the debate - it's not safety vs. risk, it's choosing between risks. Sets confrontational but evidence-based tone.

---

## SLIDE 2: The Uncomfortable Truth De Wever Won't Address
**Headline**: "Belgium Is Already Under Attack - RIGHT NOW"

**Since October 2024, Russian drones have violated Belgian airspace:**
- ✈️ Brussels, Charleroi, Liège airports → **operations halted**
- 🎖️ Belgian military bases and Royal Military School
- 🏭 Port of Antwerp - Europe's second-largest port
- ☢️ **Doel nuclear power plant** - five drones spotted
- 💰 **Cost: €2+ million per airport incident** (direct costs only)

**The Pattern Across Europe:**
- 14+ EU member states experiencing Russian hybrid warfare
- Billions lost to sabotage (energy, transport, banking, infrastructure)
- Von der Leyen's plane lost GPS signal over Bulgaria
- Poland invoked NATO Article 4 after 21 drones entered airspace

**The Question De Wever Won't Answer:**
"Do we fear *theoretical* litigation more than the *documented* cost of Russian aggression happening now?"

**Visual**: Map of Belgium with drone incident markers + cost ticker
**Supporting Documents**: IISS Russian sabotage scale report, Belgian news sources, NATO Article 4 consultation

**Note**: THIS is the emotional hook - make it visceral that Belgium is already paying. Front-loads the cost-benefit reality.

## SLIDE 3: De Wever's Impossible Logic
**Headline**: "He Blocks Every Solution While Claiming to Support Ukraine"

**De Wever simultaneously claims:**

| What He Says | The Evidence |
|--------------|--------------|
| ✓ "Ukraine needs urgent funding - before end of year" | **TRUE** - €135bn gap for 2026-2027 |
| ✗ "Russian assets too risky to use" | **BUT** blocks the Reparations Loan |
| ✗ "Coalition should fund it directly instead" | **BUT** admits: "Phone calls received: zero. Actually zero." |
| ✗ "EU debt better alternative" | **BUT** requires unanimity (Hungary veto) |
| ✓ "I'm ready, willing, able to do whatever it takes" | **SO... WHAT EXACTLY?** |

**The Logical Trap:**
If Ukraine truly needs urgent funding (✓) AND all alternatives are blocked (✗✗✗), THEN being "ready, willing, able" requires accepting the only viable option: **the Reparations Loan**.

**These positions cannot all be true. De Wever is blocking all solutions while claiming to seek one.**

**Visual**: Logic flow diagram showing the contradiction
**Quote**: "Number of phone calls I got since proposing [coalition funding]: tends to zero. It actually is zero." - Bart De Wever

**Note**: This is the intellectual knockout - exposes that his position guarantees inaction regardless of rhetoric.

---

## SLIDE 4: De Wever's Three "Problems" - Already Solved
**Headline**: "Every Concern Has an Answer He's Ignoring"

### Problem 1: "Is this even legal?"

**De Wever claims**: "Nobody has done this before - we're in uncharted waters"

**The Reality**:
- ✓ **Legal framework exists**: ARSIWA (Articles on State Responsibility) - countermeasures are lawful when aggressor violates international law
- ✓ **Historical precedents**: Iraq-Kuwait ($50bn), Iran, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Libya, Germany, Japan, Italy
- ✓ **Belgium itself benefited**: Received war reparations after WWI and WWII
- ✓ **It's not even confiscation**: Reparations Loan uses assets as **collateral**, not consumption

### Problem 2: "Guarantees - cash must be available immediately"

**De Wever claims**: "If Russia wins a claim, money must return instantly or markets panic"

**The Reality**:
- ✓ **ECB President Lagarde said "CAN be done"** with conditions (not "cannot be done")
- ✓ **Loan structure preserves assets**: They're replaced with EU bonds, not spent
- ✓ **Russia claiming return takes YEARS**: Requires (1) ending aggression, (2) winning arbitration, or (3) favorable peace treaty
- ✓ **Guarantee mechanisms exist**: Phased, conditional, insured structures

### Problem 3: "Risks left with Belgium"

**De Wever claims**: "Taking Putin's money and leaving risks with us"

**The Reality**:
- ✓ **Investment tribunal victory extremely unlikely**: CBR chances "extremely low" per legal analysis
- ✓ **EU already blocks enforcement**: 15th sanctions package prohibits recognition of arbitral awards
- ✓ **EU took GREATER risks for LESS**: Used Russian private assets to compensate investors (higher legal risk) - Ukraine's survival warrants equal tolerance
- ✓ **Multi-country participation exists**: G7 already using windfall profits; burden-sharing mechanisms available

**The Bottom Line**: De Wever presents "problems" while ignoring that solutions exist. The question isn't whether answers exist - **they do**. The question is whether Belgium will lead or obstruct.

**Visual**: Three-column table with problem / claim / solution
**Supporting Documents**: ARSIWA framework, IISS countermeasures analysis, EU legal options study, Commission reparations loan proposal, EU sanctions packages

**Note**: This slide does heavy lifting - systematically demolishes all three core objections with evidence.

## SLIDE 5: What Belgium Refuses to See
**Headline**: "The EU Already Did This for Private Investors - Why Not for Ukraine?"

**What Happened in December 2024 & July 2025:**

Belgium, Euroclear, and the EU took **much greater legal risks** to protect European investors:

| Action | What They Did | Legal Risk Level |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Dec 2024** | Used cash from Russian National Securities Depository to compensate European investors | **HIGHER RISK** |
| **July 2025** | Blocked enforcement of arbitral awards related to these actions | **Novel legal territory** |

**Why Private Investor Action Was RISKIER:**
1. Russian individuals/companies can invoke human rights protection (CBR cannot - it's 100% governmental)
2. Connection to aggression less obvious than Central Bank's direct role
3. Created precedent for using Russian assets anyway

**The Comparison:**

```
Private European Investors   →  HIGHER legal risk  →  EU acted decisively
Ukraine's Survival           →  LOWER legal risk   →  Belgium blocks it
```

**The Question for Belgium:**
"If the EU can accept greater legal uncertainty to protect private investors' portfolios, why can't it accept lesser risk to ensure Ukraine's survival and Europe's security?"

**Belgium's Choice Revealed:**
This isn't about legal risk. **Belgium already demonstrated it can manage legal risk when it wants to.** This is about political will.

**Visual**: Side-by-side comparison table showing risk levels
**Supporting Documents**: EU CFSP decisions Dec 2024, Council decisions July 2025, legal analysis of private vs. state assets

**Quote**: "When protecting investors of EU depositories... Belgium, Euroclear, and the EU demonstrated remarkable flexibility and willingness to take risks, even in legally questionable circumstances." - de-wever-argumentation.v2.md

**Note**: This is the credibility killer - proves Belgium's risk-aversion argument is selective and pretextual.

## SLIDE 6: Deep Dive - The Legal Framework
**Headline**: ARSIWA and the Doctrine of Countermeasures

**For those wanting legal details:**

**ARSIWA (Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts)**:
- Codified customary international law
- When state commits serious wrongdoing, other states may take countermeasures
- Requirements: (1) Proportional, (2) Temporary, (3) Aim to force compliance

**Russia's Violations**:
- Aggression (jus ad bellum violation)
- War crimes (peremptory norms)
- Refusal to pay compensation
- Seizure of Western assets in Russia

**Why This Qualifies**:
- Proportional: ~€300bn vs. €486bn+ reconstruction costs
- Temporary: Until Russia complies and pays reparations  
- Legitimate aim: Force Russia to end aggression and compensate

**Key Principle**: *Ex iniuria ius non oritur* - "Law does not arise from wrongdoing"

**Visual**: Legal framework flowchart
**Supporting Documents**: ARSIWA text, IISS legal analysis, EPRS study

## SLIDE 7: Deep Dive - How the Reparations Loan Works
**Headline**: Technical Mechanism Explained

**Current Situation**:
- €140bn Russian assets → Euroclear → cash at ECB
- Windfall profits → G7 loan payments

**Reparations Loan Proposal**:
- Assets remain as **collateral** (not spent)
- Cash replaced with **EU Commission bonds**
- Ukraine receives loan, repays **only after** receiving reparations from Russia
- If Russia somehow wins claim, **guarantee mechanisms** (phased, conditional, insurance structures) activate

**Key Point**: This is a **loan structure**, not consumption of assets

**Comparison to G7 Loan**:
- G7 loan: Uses only windfall profits (~€3bn/year interest)
- Reparations Loan: Uses full principal as collateral for much larger amounts

**Visual**: Infographic comparing current use vs. proposed structure
**Supporting Documents**: Commission technical analysis, Reparations Loan brief, von der Leyen options letter

## SLIDE 8: Deep Dive - Historical Precedents
**Headline**: "Nobody Has Done This Before" - Really?

**Major Historical Cases of Sovereign Asset Use:**

| Case | Year | Amount | Mechanism | Outcome |
|------|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Iraq → Kuwait** | 1991 | $50 billion | UN Compensation Commission | Assets used for reconstruction |
| **Germany & Japan** | 1945-1952 | Extensive | Allied reparations programs | Post-war reconstruction funded |
| **Italy assets** | 1954 | Significant | ICJ case, assets used | Reparations paid |
| **Argentina** | 2000s | Various | Court-ordered seizures | Sovereign debt disputes |
| **Iran** | 2016 | $1.75bn | US court orders | Terror victim compensation |

**Belgium's Own History**:
- **Post-WWI**: Received substantial reparations from Germany under Treaty of Versailles
- **Post-WWII**: Benefited from Allied reparations program
- Belgium was rebuilt with international assistance and German reparations

**The Irony**: 
Belgium benefited from the same principle it now questions. Will it deny Ukraine the justice Belgium itself received?

**Supporting Documents**: Historical treaties, UN Compensation Commission reports, ICJ decisions

## SLIDE 9: Deep Dive - Investment Tribunal Risk Analysis
**Headline**: Detailed Legal Probability Assessment

**The Belgium-Luxembourg-USSR BIT (1989)**:
- General language that *might* allow CBR to file as "investor" (uncertain)
- But CBR is 100% governmental - not typical investor

**Why Russia Would Lose (Based on Case Law)**:

1. **General International Law Takes Precedence**
   - Investment tribunals follow ICJ approach: investment disputes can't be separated from general international law
   - Russia's peremptory norm violations must be considered

2. **Countermeasures Doctrine Recognized**
   - Tribunals accept: "host State is entitled to react to another State's breach by temporarily suspending protection of the latter's investors"

3. **Non-Compensable Expropriation**
   - Criteria: (a) legitimate public purpose, (b) non-discriminatory, (c) proportional, (d) good faith
   - Using Russian assets meets all criteria

4. **Russia's Own Actions**
   - Already seized European assets (Total, Danone, Carlsberg)
   - Cannot claim protection while violating same norms

5. **EU Blocking Enforcement**
   - 15th sanctions package prohibits recognition of arbitral awards
   - Russia cannot enforce judgment in EU even if it won

**Friedman Comparison**: Private oligarch assets ≠ Central Bank state assets. Different legal frameworks entirely.

**Probability Assessment**: Chance of Russia winning = **Extremely Low**

## SLIDE 10: Secondary Arguments - Quick Rebuttals
**Headline**: Other Objections and Their Answers

### "Coalition should pay instead"
**De Wever**: "€45bn/year - coalition of willing should become coalition of bill"
**His own admission**: "Phone calls received: zero. It actually is zero."
**Rebuttal**: Why propose dead alternative? Why should EU taxpayers pay for Russian aggression?

### "Spend euro once - save for reconstruction"  
**De Wever**: "Use for war now = nothing left for reconstruction later"
**Rebuttal**: (1) No reconstruction if Ukraine loses; (2) Loan structure preserves assets; (3) Russia owes €486bn+ regardless; (4) Protects assets while Ukraine loses = protecting nothing

### "Need non-Euro countries involved"
**De Wever**: "Christine Lagarde recommended multi-country participation"
**Rebuttal**: G7 already participating with windfall profits; Eurozone hosts majority of assets; leadership doesn't require unanimity; delay for global consensus sacrifices Ukraine's immediate needs

### "Sanctions renewal risk (Hungary veto)"
**De Wever**: "If sanctions fall, 3 seconds later Russia claims money"
**Rebuttal**: (1) 26-nation model working for 3 years; (2) Even if sanctions fell, Russia needs years to claim (peace treaty or arbitration); (3) Using assets makes sanctions MORE durable (higher stakes)

### "EU debt alternative better"
**De Wever**: "We did it for COVID"
**Rebuttal**: Requires same unanimity (Hungary). Increases Member State debt. COVID was common European problem; Ukraine defense is Russian aggression problem - use aggressor's assets.

**Visual**: Quick-reference table
**Note**: These are secondary because they either contradict De Wever's main arguments or he's admitted they won't work.

## SLIDE 11: Why the Reparations Loan Is the Best Option
**Headline**: Three Options - One Clear Choice

**Commission President von der Leyen outlined three options:**

| Option | Speed | Cost to EU | Member State Debt | Political Feasibility |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1. Direct Grants | Slow | High | Increases | Low (budget constraints) |
| 2. EU-Backed Loan | Medium | Medium | Increases | Medium (unanimity needed) |
| 3. **Reparations Loan** | **Fast** | **Minimal** | **No increase** | **Highest** |

**Why Reparations Loan Wins**:
- ✓ **Cheapest**: No burden on national budgets
- ✓ **Fastest**: No new borrowing authorization needed
- ✓ **Most just**: Aggressor's assets fund victim's defense
- ✓ **Most coherent**: Direct link between Russian aggression and accountability

**Supporting Documents**: von der Leyen letter, Commission analysis

## SLIDE 12: The Strategic Imperative
**Headline**: What Happens If Europe Hesitates Again?

**Historical Pattern**:
- **1990**: Europe hesitated → Yugoslavia
- **2008**: Europe hesitated → Georgia
- **2014**: Europe hesitated → Crimea, Donbas
- **2022**: Russia launched full invasion
- **2025**: Europe's choice moment

**Each time Europe delayed, the cost grew**

**Today's Stakes**:
- Ukraine's €135bn financing gap (2026-2027) is **immediate**
- Russian hybrid warfare already costs billions and escalating
- **Moscow assumes** it can wear down Western unity
- A reparations loan **challenges both battlefield and financial attrition**

**The Choice**: Lead now and set terms, or pay much more later under worse conditions

**Visual**: Timeline of escalation + cost growth
**Supporting Documents**: Analysis of escalation pattern

## SLIDE 13: What Message Does Europe Send?
**Headline**: The Signal to the World

**If Europe Returns the Money to Russia:**
- ☐ Aggression pays
- ☐ International law has no teeth
- ☐ Threats work better than compliance
- ☐ Europe lacks resolve to defend itself

**If Europe Uses Assets for Ukraine:**
- ✓ Aggression has consequences
- ✓ International law means something
- ✓ Victims receive justice and reparations
- ✓ Europe can defend its security and values

**Moscow's Reaction**: "If we touch the money, we would feel consequences until eternity"
- **This means Russia fears EU unity on asset confiscation**
- Moscow's pressure is a sign of **policy effectiveness**, not a reason to back down

**Visual**: Two-path infographic
**Quote**: De Wever's own citation of Moscow's threat

## SLIDE 14: Belgium's Historical Moment
**Headline**: A Chance to Lead Again

**Belgium's Legacy**:
- Led Europe in building institutions to prevent war (EU origins)
- Benefited from international reparations after WWI and WWII
- Located at the heart of European decision-making

**Belgium's Current Position**:
- Hosts majority of frozen Russian assets (Euroclear)
- Holds **"Europe's key financial leverage over the Kremlin"** (De Wever's own words)
- Can shape how the mechanism works by leading rather than blocking

**The Leadership Question**:
"By promoting robust collective EU action at the European Council meeting in December, Prime Minister Bart De Wever can play a decisive leadership role in helping to end Russia's war against Ukraine and restore peace and justice in Europe."

## SLIDE 15: Summary - Solutions Exist for All Concerns
**Headline**: Comprehensive Answer Matrix

| Problem | De Wever's Concern | Solution That Exists |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **1. Legality** | "Is this even legal?" | ✓ ARSIWA framework provides legal basis<br>✓ Historical precedents exist<br>✓ Not confiscation - collateral structure<br>✓ Tribunal victory extremely unlikely |
| **2. Guarantees** | "Cash must be available immediately" | ✓ Loan structure preserves assets<br>✓ Russia claiming return requires years of process<br>✓ Guarantee mechanisms: phased, conditional, insured<br>✓ ECB said "can be done" with conditions |
| **3. Belgian Burden** | "Risks left with us" | ✓ Multi-country participation via G7<br>✓ Risk-sharing mechanisms available (Norway example)<br>✓ Leadership lets Belgium shape terms<br>✓ Cost of inaction exceeds action |

**Key Message**: These are **manageable challenges**, not insurmountable obstacles

## SLIDE 16: The Real Cost-Benefit Analysis
**Headline**: What Are We Actually Comparing?

**De Wever Focuses On (Speculative Future Risks)**:
- Possible litigation Russia might win (extremely low probability)
- Theoretical market reaction to guarantee structure
- Hypothetical Russian counter-measures

**De Wever Ignores (Concrete Present Costs)**:
- €2+ million per drone disruption (already happening)
- Billions in ongoing sabotage across Europe
- Ukraine's potential collapse without funding
- Emboldened Russia escalating hybrid warfare
- Message to other aggressors that Europe lacks resolve

**The Asymmetry**: Documented costs in billions NOW vs. speculative legal risks with low probability LATER

**Visual**: Two-scale balance heavily weighted toward concrete costs
**Supporting Documents**: IISS sabotage report, incident cost analysis

---

## SLIDE 17: Call to Action - What Should Belgium Do?
**Headline**: December Decision Points

**Belgium should:**

1. **Champion the Reparations Loan** at December European Council
2. **Shape the guarantee mechanism** through leadership rather than obstruction
3. **Mobilize European partners** for collective guarantee structure
4. **Invoke Belgium's own history** as beneficiary of war reparations
5. **Frame the choice clearly**: Lead Europe's defense of Ukraine and international law, or enable Russian aggression through paralysis

**What this looks like in practice:**
- Work with Commission on guarantee structure that addresses legitimate concerns
- Coordinate with G7 partners on burden-sharing
- Publicly commit to supporting Ukraine before December Council
- Make the moral and strategic case to Belgian public

**Visual**: Action checklist

## SLIDE 19: Closing - Belgium's Choice
**Title**: "Belgium's Choice: Lead or Follow?"

**Core Message**:
Prime Minister De Wever said Belgium holds **"Europe's key financial leverage over the Kremlin."**

The question is not whether Belgium will be affected by this decision.
**Belgium is already affected** - Russian drones fly over Belgian territory now.

The question is: **Will Belgium use its leverage to shape European security, or surrender it through inaction?**

**In 1990, 2008, and 2014, Europe hesitated. Each time, war broke out and the cost grew.**

**History is watching. Belgium can lead Europe to justice and security, or be remembered as the country that returned money to its aggressor.**

**The time to act is now. December 2025.**
