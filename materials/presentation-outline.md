# Presentation Outline: Responding to Bart De Wever's Arguments on Russian Frozen Assets

## Strategic Approach

This presentation responds to Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever's concerns about using frozen Russian assets for Ukraine. It is designed for a general audience (journalists, policymakers, civil society) and structured to work alongside your document database at frozen-assets.eu.

**Core Strategy**: Move from defensive (answering concerns) to offensive (making the positive case) while maintaining credibility through evidence-based argumentation.

## SLIDE 2: Context - The Urgent Question
**Headline**: "The December Decision"

**Key Points**:
- €140 billion in Russian Central Bank assets frozen in Europe (majority in Euroclear, Belgium)
- Ukraine faces €135 billion financing gap for 2026-2027
- European Council decision needed by December 2025
- Prime Minister De Wever raised concerns at October Council meeting

## SLIDE 3: De Wever's Three Core Concerns
**Headline**: "Three Problems Must Be Solved"

De Wever has focused on three "essential" concerns (down from 10 in Copenhagen):

1. **Legal Uncertainty**: "Is this even legal? Nobody has done this before."
2. **Liquidity Guarantees**: "Cash must be available immediately if Russia wins a claim."
3. **Belgian Burden**: "Taking Putin's money and leaving the risks with us - that's not happening."

**Visual**: Three pillars/columns graphic
**Quote**: "If we find solutions for these three problems then maybe we can go ahead. If not, maybe another option." - Bart De Wever

**Note**: Uses De Wever's own framing to show we're engaging seriously with his concerns.

## SLIDE 4: Concern #1 - "Is This Legal?"
**Headline**: De Wever's Claim vs. Legal Reality

**De Wever Says**:
- "Nobody has ever done this before - we're in uncharted waters"
- "Even during WWII, central bank money was not touched"
- "Japan decided central bank money is immune"

**The Reality**:
✓ **Legal basis exists**: International law experts confirm countermeasures are legitimate under ARSIWA (Articles on State Responsibility)
✓ **Historical precedents exist**: Iraq-Kuwait ($50bn), plus seizures from Iran, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Libya, Germany, Japan, Italy
✓ **Belgium benefited from this principle**: Received reparations after both WWI and WWII

**Visual**: Timeline of historical precedents
**Supporting Documents**: EPRS legal analysis, IISS countermeasures study, ARSIWA articles

**Note**: Directly contradicts "unprecedented" claim with evidence.

---

## SLIDE 5: What Makes It Legal?
**Headline**: The Legal Framework for Countermeasures

**When a state commits serious wrongdoing (like Russia's aggression), international law allows countermeasures:**

1. **Temporary suspension** of certain obligations toward the aggressor state
2. **Proportional response** to force compliance with international law
3. **Legitimate until** aggressor ends violation and pays reparations

**Key Principle**: *Ex iniuria ius non oritur* - "Law does not arise from wrongdoing"
- Russia cannot claim legal protection for assets while violating fundamental international law

**The Proposal**: Not even full confiscation - assets serve as **collateral** for reparations loan Ukraine repays only after receiving compensation from Russia

**Visual**: Flow chart showing legal logic
**Supporting Documents**: EPRS legal options study, IISS countermeasures analysis

---

## SLIDE 6: Concern #2 - "Liquidity Guarantee"
**Headline**: De Wever's Claim vs. Financial Reality

**De Wever Says**:
- "Christine Lagarde confirmed cash must be guaranteed and immediately available"
- "If sanctions fall or courts rule, money must return instantly or markets lose trust"
- "This is probably the most important problem"

**The Reality**:
✓ **Lagarde said "can be done"** with conditions - not "cannot be done"
✓ **Reparations Loan structure** means assets aren't "spent" - they're replaced with Commission bonds
✓ **Russia claiming return requires**: (1) ending aggression, (2) complying with international law, (3) winning arbitration, or (4) favorable peace treaty - **none are rapid processes**

**Visual**: Comparison chart - "What De Wever Implies" vs. "Actual Loan Structure"
**Supporting Documents**: Commission proposal on reparations loan, von der Leyen's letter on options

---

## SLIDE 7: How the Reparations Loan Actually Works
**Headline**: Not Confiscation - Collateralization

**Current Situation**:
- €140bn Russian assets → Euroclear → cash at ECB
- Windfall profits → G7 loan payments

**Reparations Loan Proposal**:
- Assets remain as **collateral** (not spent)
- Cash replaced with **EU Commission bonds**
- Ukraine receives loan, repays **only after** receiving reparations from Russia
- If Russia somehow wins claim, **guarantee mechanisms** (phased, conditional, insurance structures) activate

**Key Point**: This is a **loan structure**, not consumption of assets

**Visual**: Infographic comparing current use vs. proposed structure
**Supporting Documents**: Commission technical analysis, Reparations Loan brief

---

## SLIDE 8: Concern #3 - "Belgian Burden"
**Headline**: De Wever's Claim vs. Strategic Reality

**De Wever Says**:
- "Belgium holds the biggest chicken - the fattest chicken is in Belgium"
- "We're the only ones doing anything - others provide no transparency"
- "It's a bit sour we're fingerpointed as the unwilling country"
- "We're the best boy in town!"

**The Reality**:
✓ Belgium's position is a **leadership opportunity**, not victimhood
✓ By leading, Belgium can **shape how the mechanism works**
✓ **Belgium's historical role**: Led in building European institutions; received reparations after both World Wars
✓ **The alternative**: Return money to an aggressor already conducting drone warfare over Belgian territory

**Visual**: Map showing Belgian leadership in European history
**Quote**: "Belgium has a chance to play a pivotal role in European security. Will it lead the way?"

## SLIDE 9: The Cost Belgium Is Already Paying
**Headline**: Russia's Hybrid War Against Belgium - NOW

**Since October 2024, Russian drones have been spotted over**:
- Brussels, Charleroi, Liège airports → **operations halted**
- Belgian military bases
- Royal Military School
- Port of Antwerp
- **Doel nuclear power plant**

**Economic Impact**:
- **€2+ million per airport disruption incident** (direct costs only)
- Billions in sabotage across Europe (energy, transport, banking, infrastructure)
- **Pattern across 14+ EU member states**

**The Question**: Do we fear the theoretical cost of litigation more than the documented cost of ongoing Russian aggression?

**Visual**: Map of drone incidents across Belgium + cost estimates
**Supporting Documents**: IISS report on Russian sabotage scale, news reports on incidents

## SLIDE 10: "What About Litigation Risk?"
**Headline**: De Wever's Worst-Case Scenario vs. Actual Legal Analysis

**De Wever Says**:
- "Buried in litigation - seems like a certainty"
- "Consequences until eternity"
- "Friedman claiming €16bn for €8bn frozen"
- "If 180bn taken, claims could reach €360bn"

**The Reality**:
✓ **Investment tribunal jurisdiction**: Uncertain if Russia's Central Bank even qualifies as "investor" under BIT
✓ **Chance of Russia winning**: **Extremely low** based on case law analysis
✓ **Why Russia would lose**: (1) Russia's violations of peremptory norms; (2) Russia already seized European assets; (3) Non-compensable expropriation doctrine applies
✓ **EU already blocking enforcement**: 15th sanctions package prohibits recognition of arbitral awards related to these disputes

**Key Point**: Friedman case involves **private assets** and different legal framework than CBR **state assets**

**Visual**: Flow chart - "Can Russia Win?" with probability assessments at each stage
**Supporting Documents**: Legal analysis of BIT, tribunal case law review, EU sanctions packages

## SLIDE 11: EU Already Took Greater Risks for Lesser Objectives
**Headline**: Precedent: The EU Acted Boldly to Protect Private Investors

**What EU Already Did (Dec 2024, July 2025)**:
- Used cash from Russian National Securities Depository to compensate European investors
- **This created GREATER litigation risk** because: (1) Russian individuals/companies can invoke human rights; (2) Connection to aggression less obvious
- EU then **blocked enforcement** of related arbitral awards

**The Comparison**:
| Action | Legal Risk | Objective |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| 2024-25 Actions | HIGHER | Protect private European investors |
| Reparations Loan | LOWER | Support Ukraine's survival & European security |

**Key Point**: EU already demonstrated it can manage litigation risk. Ukraine's survival warrants **at least** equal risk tolerance.

**Supporting Documents**: EU CFSP decisions Dec 2024, Council decisions July 2025

---

## SLIDE 12: "Can't Other Countries Pay Instead?"
**Headline**: The "Coalition of the Bill" Argument

**De Wever's Proposal**:
- "Coalition of the willing should become coalition of the bill"
- "€45 billion/year to keep Ukraine afloat - not a lot of money"
- "Countries who are willing to pay could easily do so"

**De Wever's Own Evidence This Won't Happen**:
> "Number of phone calls I got since proposing this: tends to zero. It actually is zero." - Bart De Wever

**The Reality**:
✓ Major EU states face **budgetary constraints** (Germany, France, Poland)
✓ Direct grants/debt **politically impossible** (requires unanimity - Hungary problem)
✓ **Why should European taxpayers pay** for Russian aggression when Russian assets are available?

**Visual**: Quote graphic of "zero phone calls" admission
**Supporting Documents**: Budget constraint analysis, G7 discussions

---

## SLIDE 13: "What About Reconstruction After the War?"
**Headline**: The "Spend Euro Once" Argument

**De Wever Says**:
- "You can only spend the euro once"
- "If you use it all for war, reconstruction gets zero"
- "It will be us again" having to pay

**The Reality**:
✓ **No reconstruction without winning first** - there's nothing to reconstruct if Ukraine loses
✓ **Loan structure preserves assets** - they're collateral, not consumed
✓ **Russia's liability exceeds frozen assets** - €300bn frozen vs. €486bn reconstruction costs (and rising daily)
✓ **Alternative reconstruction financing** exists: Marshall Plan-style programs, World Bank, private investment

**Key Point**: De Wever's logic inverts causality - protecting frozen assets for reconstruction while letting Ukraine lose the war guarantees there's nothing to reconstruct

## SLIDE 14: Why the Reparations Loan Is the Best Option
**Headline**: Three Options - One Clear Choice

**Commission President von der Leyen outlined three options:**

| Option | Speed | Cost to EU | Member State Debt | Political Feasibility |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1. Direct Grants | Slow | High | Increases | Low (budget constraints) |
| 2. EU-Backed Loan | Medium | Medium | Increases | Medium (unanimity needed) |
| 3. **Reparations Loan** | **Fast** | **Minimal** | **No increase** | **Highest** |

**Why Reparations Loan Wins**:
- ✓ **Cheapest**: No burden on national budgets
- ✓ **Fastest**: No new borrowing authorization needed
- ✓ **Most just**: Aggressor's assets fund victim's defense
- ✓ **Most coherent**: Direct link between Russian aggression and accountability

**Visual**: Comparison matrix
**Supporting Documents**: von der Leyen letter, Commission analysis

## SLIDE 15: The Strategic Imperative
**Headline**: What Happens If Europe Hesitates Again?

**Historical Pattern**:
- **1990**: Europe hesitated → Yugoslavia
- **2008**: Europe hesitated → Georgia
- **2014**: Europe hesitated → Crimea, Donbas
- **2022**: Russia launched full invasion
- **2025**: Europe's choice moment

**Each time Europe delayed, the cost grew**

**Today's Stakes**:
- Ukraine's €135bn financing gap (2026-2027) is **immediate**
- Russian hybrid warfare already costs billions and escalating
- **Moscow assumes** it can wear down Western unity
- A reparations loan **challenges both battlefield and financial attrition**

**The Choice**: Lead now and set terms, or pay much more later under worse conditions

**Visual**: Timeline of escalation + cost growth
**Supporting Documents**: Analysis of escalation pattern

## SLIDE 16: What Message Does Europe Send?
**Headline**: The Signal to the World

**If Europe Returns the Money to Russia:**
- ☐ Aggression pays
- ☐ International law has no teeth
- ☐ Threats work better than compliance
- ☐ Europe lacks resolve to defend itself

**If Europe Uses Assets for Ukraine:**
- ✓ Aggression has consequences
- ✓ International law means something
- ✓ Victims receive justice and reparations
- ✓ Europe can defend its security and values

**Moscow's Reaction**: "If we touch the money, we would feel consequences until eternity"
- **This means Russia fears EU unity on asset confiscation**
- Moscow's pressure is a sign of **policy effectiveness**, not a reason to back down

**Visual**: Two-path infographic
**Quote**: De Wever's own citation of Moscow's threat

## SLIDE 17: Belgium's Historical Moment
**Headline**: A Chance to Lead Again

**Belgium's Legacy**:
- Led Europe in building institutions to prevent war (EU origins)
- Benefited from international reparations after WWI and WWII
- Located at the heart of European decision-making

**Belgium's Current Position**:
- Hosts majority of frozen Russian assets (Euroclear)
- Holds **"Europe's key financial leverage over the Kremlin"** (De Wever's own words)
- Can shape how the mechanism works by leading rather than blocking

**The Leadership Question**:
"By promoting robust collective EU action at the European Council meeting in December, Prime Minister Bart De Wever can play a decisive leadership role in helping to end Russia's war against Ukraine and restore peace and justice in Europe."

## SLIDE 18: Answering De Wever's "Three Problems"
**Headline**: Solutions Exist for All Three Concerns

| Problem | De Wever's Concern | Solution That Exists |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **1. Legality** | "Is this even legal?" | ✓ ARSIWA framework provides legal basis<br>✓ Historical precedents exist<br>✓ Not confiscation - collateral structure<br>✓ Tribunal victory extremely unlikely |
| **2. Guarantees** | "Cash must be available immediately" | ✓ Loan structure preserves assets<br>✓ Russia claiming return requires years of process<br>✓ Guarantee mechanisms: phased, conditional, insured<br>✓ ECB said "can be done" with conditions |
| **3. Belgian Burden** | "Risks left with us" | ✓ Multi-country participation via G7<br>✓ Risk-sharing mechanisms available (Norway example)<br>✓ Leadership lets Belgium shape terms<br>✓ Cost of inaction exceeds action |

**Key Message**: These are **manageable challenges**, not insurmountable obstacles

**Visual**: Three-column comparison table

---

## SLIDE 19: What About the Other Arguments?
**Headline**: Quick Rebuttals to Secondary Concerns

**"Need non-Euro country participation"**
→ G7 already participating; leadership doesn't require unanimity; Eurozone hosts majority of assets

**"Sanctions renewal vulnerability (Hungary)"**
→ 26-member model working for 3 years; assets strengthen sanctions durability; extension mechanisms exist

**"EU debt alternative better"**
→ De Wever admits this requires unanimity (Hungary problem); increases Member State debt; why should European taxpayers pay for Russian aggression?

**"Coalition should fund it directly"**
→ De Wever admits "zero phone calls received" - this alternative is dead

**Note**: These secondary arguments either contradict each other or contradict De Wever's primary concerns (show sophistication by not spending too much time here)

**Visual**: Quick bullet-point format

---

## SLIDE 20: The Fundamental Contradiction
**Headline**: De Wever's Unsolvable Dilemma

**De Wever simultaneously claims:**
1. ✓ "Ukraine needs urgent funding - before end of year"
2. ✗ "Russian assets too risky to use"
3. ✗ "Direct funding from coalition won't happen" (zero calls)
4. ✗ "Debt financing politically impossible" (unanimity problem)
5. ✓ "I'm ready, willing, and able to do whatever it takes to help Ukraine"

**These positions cannot all be true.**

If Ukraine truly needs urgent funding (1) AND all alternatives are blocked (2-4), THEN being "ready, willing, able" (5) requires accepting manageable risks with the only viable option: the Reparations Loan.

**The Choice**: Perfectionism that guarantees failure, or acceptable risk that enables Ukraine's survival?

**Visual**: Logic flow showing contradiction
**Note**: This is the presentation's intellectual climax - showing the argumentative trap

---

## SLIDE 21: The Real Cost-Benefit Analysis
**Headline**: What Are We Actually Comparing?

**De Wever Focuses On (Speculative Future Risks)**:
- Possible litigation Russia might win (extremely low probability)
- Theoretical market reaction to guarantee structure
- Hypothetical Russian counter-measures

**De Wever Ignores (Concrete Present Costs)**:
- €2+ million per drone disruption (already happening)
- Billions in ongoing sabotage across Europe
- Ukraine's potential collapse without funding
- Emboldened Russia escalating hybrid warfare
- Message to other aggressors that Europe lacks resolve

**The Asymmetry**: Documented costs in billions NOW vs. speculative legal risks with low probability LATER

**Visual**: Two-scale balance heavily weighted toward concrete costs
**Supporting Documents**: IISS sabotage report, incident cost analysis

## SLIDE 22: Call to Action - What Should Belgium Do?
**Headline**: December Decision Points

**Belgium should:**

1. **Champion the Reparations Loan** at December European Council
2. **Shape the guarantee mechanism** through leadership rather than obstruction
3. **Mobilize European partners** for collective guarantee structure
4. **Invoke Belgium's own history** as beneficiary of war reparations
5. **Frame the choice clearly**: Lead Europe's defense of Ukraine and international law, or enable Russian aggression through paralysis

**What this looks like in practice:**
- Work with Commission on guarantee structure that addresses legitimate concerns
- Coordinate with G7 partners on burden-sharing
- Publicly commit to supporting Ukraine before December Council
- Make the moral and strategic case to Belgian public

**Visual**: Action checklist

## SLIDE 24: Closing - Time to Choose
**Title**: "Belgium's Choice: Lead or Follow?"

**Core Message**:
Prime Minister De Wever said Belgium holds **"Europe's key financial leverage over the Kremlin."**

The question is not whether Belgium will be affected by this decision.
**Belgium is already affected** - Russian drones fly over Belgian territory now.

The question is: **Will Belgium use its leverage to shape European security, or surrender it through inaction?**

**In 1990, 2008, and 2014, Europe hesitated. Each time, war broke out and the cost grew.**

**History is watching. Belgium can lead Europe to justice and security, or be remembered as the country that returned money to its aggressor.**

**The time to act is now. December 2025.**
